                            This is probably the most beautiful project in the Health sector that I’m
                            aware of. It brings out the best in doctors, students, corporate employees,
                            mayors and pretty much everybody else. each and every one of them returns
                            home with something gained. The best part is that this is the kind of
                            project which, if it were to become a national program, it would generate a
                            change in the system. It would diminish one of Romania’s biggest problems,
                            which is unfortunately too seldom talked about: living in a Romanian
                            village as opposed to living in the city shortens one’s life expectancy.
                            Congratulations, Caravan with Doctors, I’m truly honored to know you!

                            E probabil cel mai frumos proiect din Sănătate pe care care-l cunosc: unul
                            care scoate ce-i mai bun și din medici, și din studenți, și din
                            corporatiști, și din primari și din toată lumea... Fiecare pleacă acasă cu
                            ceva câștigat. Dar cel mai tare e că e genul de proiect care, dacă ar fi
                            scalat la nivel național, ar produce o schimbare de sistem. Ar diminua una
                            din problemele mari ale României dar despre care vorbim foarte foarte
                            puțin:- dacă locuiești la sat în România, speranța ta de viață e automat
                            mai mică decât a unuia care stă la oraș. Felicitări Caravana cu Medici.

                            Ciofeni is a unique village.
                            Agriculture is still practiced here as means of earning a living, old age
                            is seen as a common feature and people regard illnesses as something
                            normal. They are not seeking relief or any kind of treatment because “it is
                            normal to feel pain after you worked your entire life”. The main concern of
                            the villagers is not the television, nor the pills, but ensuring themselves
                            a meal each day. One more thing I seldom experienced in the urban areas is
                            the fact that poverty hasn’t embittered the people and hasn’t indoctrinated
                            them. I consulted some wonderful persons; they were clean, wise and, above
                            all, wise. After spending a day in the caravan I feel I gained more than
                            anyone there.

                            The day spent in the caravan was one of the few occasions I truly felt I
                            was taken seriously as a future doctor; while working alongside doctors,
                            not under their command. This was very important to me as I realized for
                            good the responsibility I will be bearing towards my patients and I asked
                            myself if I was really doing my best in order to fulfill their
                            expectations. I see the Caravan as a magical project, a display of
                            humanity, encompassing the utopic ideas we – the medical students – had in
                            high school when we were thinking of going to med school. Thank you!

                            In a country like Romania, where if you don’t have the right connections,
                            if you don’t know someone who knows someone, if you get sick you are very
                            likely to be on your own. The doctors from the caravan not only give free
                            consults and write prescriptions, but also they create a network which
                            helps the patients reach the hospital easier when they need to. The
                            volunteers give their personal contact details to the patients in order to
                            be able to give them further support when they arrive into town. This is
                            indeed a truly successful story, but the difficulties encountered by the
                            caravan are also real, multiple and typical for the Romanian system.

                            Stefanut is 2 years old and has been coughing for 4 days. His mother can’t
                            say for sure if any fever spiked, because she doesn’t afford a thermometer.
                            Luckily, she found some ibuprofen, the only remedy she had to give to her
                            son. She knows a doctor’s advice would have helped, but there no one was in
                            the village to examine him. After I consulted him, I discovered a kind and
                            well behaved child, curious about my stethoscope. After receiving a bottle
                            of juice and some snacks he smiled with satisfaction. He has acute

                            medication.After recommending the prescription, I discovered that I wrote
                            it in vain, as the mother could not afford to buy all the pills. With the
                            help of the local priest and my team we were able to buy the family all the
                            materials and medicine needed.

                            I was deeply impressed by how rapidly the volunteers formed a team, within
                            minutes of meeting each other. I will not fail to mention the reaction of
                            the community in which they go. The people here were engaged in supporting
                            and welcoming them as best they could – hosting, cooking and helping in any
                            way possible. If I were to conclude, I would say that the determination I
                            see in this NGO I would like to encounter more in Romania. It is an
                            experience that fills you with hope, hope that these kind of things are
                            possible.
